# Hangman
**Hangman** is a simple application of a one-player Hangman game.
To start a game, execute the src/main.py file.

## Rules
A game of Hangman plays as a loop of turns, during which:
  - the terminal shows the player a blank word,
  - it asks for input from the player - only new single letters are accepted,
  - depending on the guess being right or wrong, the player discovers letters or loses lives.

The player is given 5 lives. When he is out of lives, the game is over.

## Example of the game running:
