Python v3 or above is required.

## Rules
A game of Hangman plays as a loop of turns, during which:
  - the terminal shows the player the word, with blanks standing for mystery letters,
  - it asks for input from the player - only new single letters are accepted,
  - depending on the guess being right or wrong, the player discovers letters or loses lives.

The player is given 5 lives. When they're out of lives, the game is over.
